# Game Playing with Genetic Algorithms

This is an academic AI project geared towards a broader understanding of Genetic Algorithms. 
The idea for this project came from projects similar to this one (Google's Deepmind, implementations of the NEAT algorithm for game playing, etc.). 
The goal was to use a pure genetic algorithm(no use of artificial neural networks) to complete a level of Super Mario Bros. 
The project went from using simple methods for crossover, selection, and mutation, to creating our own algorithm for the project. 
Our algorithm was made up from hours of research into many different machine learning techniques. 
The algorithm is detailed in the commenting of the code(Ongoing).
This is a fun and very engaging project that led to a much deeper understanding of learning as a whole. 

Things you will need:

For Super Mario Bros.
1. FCEUX Emulator - http://www.fceux.com/web/download.html
2. A ROM of Super Mario Bros. (Japan, USA)
3. The code.

For Super Mario World (Coming Soon)
1. Bizhawk Emulator - 
2. A ROM of Super Mario World (USA)
3. The code.

Pop the code into a folder, start up a new game and once the level starts, run the main script through FCEUX or Bizhawk depending on the game.
You can speed up the Emulation using the Turbo function in FCEUX.
(Super Mario Bros.) Level 1-1 can be completed too easily just based on random chance alone, so I recommend playing up to level 1-2 and starting the script.
As of now the Genetic Algorithm converges on a solution in around 16 generations for Super Mario Bros. Results may vary though.
Super Mario World is currently being tested

The project is ongoing and will be used with different games in time.
